# Silly Buttons
Silly buttons is a PHP button clicker embed.

## Set Up
Requirements: A PHP web server

1. Download files. You only need `index.php` and `buttons.csv`.
2. Edit `buttons.csv` to the button options you want. Make sure each has its own ID number.
3. Edit the button styling in `index.php` if you want. There's CSS variables for quick color edits.
4. Upload your file to your server and CHMOD `buttons.csv` to 640 so it can't be accessed publically.
5. Embed your buttons on your site's 'about me' page.
